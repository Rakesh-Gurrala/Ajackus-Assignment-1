Project Introduction: Objective: The User Management Dashboard project is made for the administrators to keep the user data by means of adding, editing, and deleting user records. it makes the management of major user information easy, like firstName, lastName, emailS, & department. Overview: The App Creates a Dynamic and User-Friendly interface using standard web technologies such as HTML,CSS, & JavaScript. it simulates the backend interaction by means of APIs and provides the visual display of data either as a graphical representation or as a table.

Features and Functionalities: Add User: User can input their data (first name, last name, email, department), which will then be displayed in the table after submission. Edit User Data: Each user entry shows an “Edit” button, which if initiated by an Admin allows the user to proceed with the editing of the user’s details, which afterward will consider the changes done and reflect them back in the table. Delete User Data: Users can be deleted from the table by clicking the “Delete” button. API Integration: This application integrates with JSONPlaceholder APIs to simulate real storage and management of data for adding new users.

Technical Architecture: Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): The user interface consists of HTML elements such as forms and tables used to display and manage data. CSS is used to style the UI elements in an appealing way. JavaScript handles the various user interactions of adding, editing, and deleting users without the need for refreshing the page.

API Calls (Fetch API): The frontend uses the Fetch API built into JavaScript to mock the communication between the frontend and the backend (JSONPlaceholder) in order to simulate the creation, updating, and deletion of users.

Dynamic Table Rendering: It shows the user data in a table and updates dynamically on any change.

Conclusion: This project serves as a basic example of managing user data using a simple front-end interface and APIs. It showcases core front-end development skills, such as form handling, DOM manipulation, and interaction with APIs, while laying the groundwork for future enhancements like backend integration and user authentication.
